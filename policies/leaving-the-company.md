# Leaving the Company

Should you decide to leave your employment with us, we ask that you provide your supervisor and the business operations manager with at least two week's advance written notice. Your thoughtfulness is appreciated and will be noted favorably should you ever wish to reapply for employment with the company.

Employees, who are rehired following a break in service in excess of one month, other than an approved leave of absence, must serve a new initial introductory period whether or not such a period was previously completed. Such employees are considered new employees from the effective date of their reemployment for all purposes, including the purposes of measuring benefits.

Our company does not provide a "letter of reference" to former employees. Generally, we will confirm upon request our employees' dates of employment, salary history and job title.

Additionally, all resigning employees should complete a brief exit interview prior to leaving. All company property must be returned upon termination. Otherwise, the company may take action to recoup any replacement costs and/or seek the return of company property through appropriate legal recourse.
