# Pay

## Payday

If you are an employee in the US, you will be paid biweekly on Friday for the period that ends on the previous Sunday. If you are an employee outside of the US, you will be paid monthly on the 25th of the month, for the preceding month.

If a payday falls on a nonworking day, employees will be paid the preceding workday.

Please review your paycheck for errors. If you find an error, report it to [management@thoughtbot.com](mailto:management@thoughtbot.com) immediately.

## Direct Deposit

Your pay will be deposited into your bank account through our direct deposit program. To edit your direct deposit information, use [BambooHR][bamboo-link]. Everyone who needs to know will be alerted when you do that.

## Payroll System

For US employees, we use [ViewPayroll][viewpayroll-link]. You can use it to view your pay stubs, pay dates, and W2/1099, and paycheck deductions (e.g. 401K). If you do not know your username/password for this, please [email benefits](mailto:benefits@thoughtbot.com).

For employees outside of the US, we do not have payroll online. Please email [management@thoughtbot.com](mailto:management@thoughtbot.com) if you have questions about your payroll.

## Paycheck Deductions

The company is required by law to make certain deductions from your paycheck each pay period. Such deductions typically include federal and state taxes and Social Security (FICA) taxes. Depending on the state in which you are employed and the benefits you choose, there may be additional deductions. All deductions and the amount of the deductions are listed on your pay stub. These deductions are totaled each year for you on your Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement.

It is the policy of the company that exempt (salaried) employees' pay will not be “docked,” or subject to deductions, in violation of salary pay rules issued by the United States Department of Labor and any corresponding rules issued by the state government, as applicable. However, the company may make deductions from employees' salaries in a way that is permitted under federal and state wage and hour rules. Employees will be reimbursed in full for any isolated, inadvertent, or improper deductions, as defined by law.

Thus, exempt employees may be subject to the following salary deductions, except where prohibited by state law, but only for the following reasons:

* Absences of one or more full days for personal reasons, other than sickness or disability; or
* Absences of one or more full days due to sickness or disability, if there is a plan, policy, or practice providing replacement compensation for such absences; or
* Absences of one or more full days before eligibility under such a plan, policy, or practice or after replacement compensation for such absences has been exhausted; or
* Suspensions of one or more full days for violations of safety rules of major significance; or
* Suspensions of one or more full days for violations of written workplace conduct rules, such as rules against sexual harassment and workplace violence; or
* Payment of actual time worked in the first and last weeks of employment, resulting in a proportional rate of an employee's full salary; or
* Any unpaid leave taken under the Family and Medical Leave Act; or
* Negative paid-time-off balances, in whole-day increments only.

## Garnishment / Child Support

When an employee's wages are garnished by a court order, our company is legally bound to withhold the amount indicated in the garnishment order from the employee's paycheck. Our company will, however, honor federal and applicable state guidelines that protect a certain amount of an employee's income from being subject to garnishment.

## Overtime

Our goal is to work effectively and as such we are committed to a 40 hour work week. In rare circumstances, where a project prompts overtime, we will provide advance notice and require that you get the overtime approved by your supervisor.

Hourly (Non-exempt) employees will be paid time and one-half, unless state law provides a greater benefit in which case, we will comply with the state law. All overtime requires prior approval by your supervisor. Salaried (Exempt) employees will be paid straight time for overtime when the overtime is initiated by client demand and only after approved by your supervisor.

Salaried (Exempt) employees will receive compensatory (comp) time for overtime when the overtime is not initiated by client demand, and only after approved by your supervisor. Comp. time needs to be taken within 2 weeks of the overtime, and cannot be carried over.

Time spent traveling to, attending, and returning from company approved activities, such as client visits will be considered time worked. Time spent in another location that is not actual work time will not be counted as work hours. In such event that the employee exceeds 40 hours worked in a week, the employee will be paid overtime in accordance with federal and state regulations.

Only hours that are actually worked are counted toward computing weekly overtime. Holidays and paid days off are not considered hours worked for purposes of computing overtime.
