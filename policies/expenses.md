# Expenses

## Overview & General Guidelines for Expense Reporting

All full-time, non-apprentice employees will receive a thoughtbot credit card in their name. These cards are to be used for non-personal, business expenses only, and are intended to eliminate the reimbursement process. US employees get an [American Express][amex-link]. Employees in Sweden get a [Mastercard][mastercard-link].

We trust individuals to use their judgement as to what is and is not an appropriate business expense, but we’ve provided some guidelines below.

## Overview of reporting your expenses:

1. Receipts must be submitted for all purchases. 
2. When you owe the company or the company owes you, please email your receipts to [reimbursements@thoughtbot.com](mailto:reimbursements@thoughtbot.com).
3. If the purchase is fully covered by thoughtbot & on a company credit card- simply submit the receipt to [Shoeboxed][shoeboxed-link] with a note.

Apprentices should use their Mentor’s card and their Mentor should follow the expense reporting procedure.

## Purchasing Guidelines

### Meals and Entertainment

Meal expenses while traveling on business are OK only if your trip is overnight or long enough that you need to stop for sleep or rest to properly perform your duties. Non-travel-related meals and entertainment are OK as long as business takes place immediately before, during, or after the meal, or if there is a reasonable expectation of deriving a specific business benefit from the meal or entertainment.

### Books and Other Training Materials

Feel free to order whatever books you’d like, as long as they are directly related to the work performed by thoughtbot.

### Subscription services

If you want to buy a multi-person license to access content or a service – first, take a deep breath. You’re on the road to content nirvana. Then:
* Get permission from your manager.
* Post a message to R&D and ask who’s interested in participating with you.
* When you know how many, buy the appropriate license.

If we need to associate the account with an owner/buyer/licensee, use [purchasing@thoughtbot.com](mailto:purchasing@thoughtbot.com) for that purpose.

## Invoices

If you receive an invoice that needs to be paid by check, wire transfer, or paypal, the invoice should be sent to [purchasing@thoughtbot.com](mailto:purchasing@thoughtbot.com).

Include any notes about how the invoice should be paid or when in this email along with the invoice.

Invoices should ﻿not ﻿be sent to shoeboxed. 

### Submitting Receipts with Notes to Shoeboxed

All receipts for purchases on your thoughtbot credit card need to be uploaded to [Shoeboxed][shoeboxed-link] with a note. Our accountant uses Shoeboxed to balance the books.

### Note your expenses properly

Whenever possible, please write your expense note on each receipt especially if you are using the Shoeboxed Mobile App. This makes it easier to visually sort each submission. For e-mail submissions, you can include your expense note on the subject line.

Your note should contain 3 simple things:

* **What?**  
Team outing, meal, travel, software, computer equipment, hosting, marketing, etc.

* **Where?**  
Boston, San Francisco, Denver, Stockholm, NYC, Philadelphia, Raleigh, Austin (Write "Corporate" if not for a specific office/location.)

* **Why?**  
General, Learn or Consulting: Consulting includes meet-ups, conferences or other promotional activity, in addition to purchases directly related to client work.  Learn includes workshops, prime, tb books, etc.

#### Examples

|Expense|Categorization|
|:------|:-------------|
|Lunch at RailsConf for NYC employee|Meal / NYC / Consulting|
|Taxi to client meeting in Denver|Travel / Denver / Consulting|
|Propane for laptop in Austin|Software / Austin / General|
|Workshop lunch in Boston|Meal / Boston / Learn|

*Sweden employees are also required to include the number of people at meals, meetups etc.

## Mileage Reimbursement

When you use your own vehicle and your own gas for work purposes, you will be reimbursed for mileage above your regular drive to work at the IRS rate. Currently, the rate is 56.5 cents per mile.

Mileage for a 2-week pay period should be submitted to Anna on the last day of the pay period (the Friday before you get you paid.)

Alternatively, you can purchase gas on your tb card for work travel. You will not receive a mileage reimbursement if you purchase gas on your tb card.

## Reimbursements for Out-of-Pocket Expenses

In the event that you purchase something out of pocket, please email the receipt with a note to [reimbursements@thoughtbot.com](mailto:reimbursements@thoughtbot.com).

Reimbursements will be made directly to you via your bi-weekly pay check.

Reimbursements will typically occur in the paycheck immediately following the expense, or event (in the case of a conference, the reimbursements will happen after the conference is over).

Please report your out-of-pocket expense as soon as it occurs.

## When you owe the company

In the case, such as with conference expenses, where you actually owe the company, the expense will be deducted directly from your bi-weekly paycheck.

Please email the receipts with a note to [reimbursements@thoughtbot.com](mailto:reimbursements@thoughtbot.com).

Deductions will typically occur in the paycheck immediately following the expense, or event (in the case of a conference, the deductions will happen after the conference is over).

## Personal Expenses

The corporate credit cards are not for personal expenses.  They are for business expenses only.  Ask your manager if you have an exceptional financial circumstance where the company might provide personal assistance via payroll advance or some other means.
