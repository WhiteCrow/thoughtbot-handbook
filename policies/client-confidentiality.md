# Client Confidentiality

Our professional ethics require that each employee maintain the highest degree of confidentiality when handling client matters.

To maintain this professional confidence, no employee shall disclose client information to outsiders, including other clients or third parties and members of one's own family.

Under no circumstances will outside requests for client material be fulfilled unless prior written permission is received from your supervisor.
