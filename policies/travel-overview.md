# Travel Overview

## Required Travel

All expenses are fully covered by thoughtbot when travel is required as part of your job. These types of trips include visiting a client, teaching a workshop, etc.

## Conference Travel

The cost to attend a conference is split 50/50 between thoughtbot and the attendee when the conference has been approved by management. This includes conference fees, hotel, food and transportation. If you are speaking at a conference, thoughtbot will cover all your expenses. Please see the [Conference][conferences] page for more details.

## Inter-Office Travel

When an employee elects to visit another office and the trip is approved by management, thoughtbot will cover the cost of traveling to the office and your hotel. Please note- food is not covered for this type of optional travel. Please see the [Inter-Office Travel][inter-office-travel] page for specifics on arranging a trip.

## Combination Trips

### Attending a conference & visiting an office in one trip:

thoughtbot will cover the cost of the traveling to the office and the hotel for the office visit portion of the trip. The employee is responsible for 50% travel and lodging costs above the cost of the office visit. Therefore, hotel for the conference portion of the trip will be split 50/50 between the employee and thoughtbot. If attending the conference results in additional transportation fees, that additional cost will also be split 50/50. This type of trip must be approved in advance by a manager.

### Personal travel in connection with any type of thoughbot travel:

When an employee takes a personal detour or extension before or after any type of work travel, the employee is responsible for the additional cost. This may include additional flights or nights in a hotel. thoughtbot will pay the same amount that would have been covered by thoughtbot had there not been a personal detour or extension. The employee may garner whatever personal benefit they can from being put closer to their personal destination. This type of trip must be approved in advance by a manager.

### Work travel as a side effect of personal travel:

When an employee has an already scheduled personal trip near a thoughtbot location, we encourage them to stop in and work from the thoughtbot office during their trip. The company will cover whatever additional costs are incurred by extending the personal trip to include the time at the thoughtbot location office. This type of trip must be approved in advance by a manager.
