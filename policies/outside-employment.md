# Outside Employment

We hope that you will not find it necessary to seek additional outside employment. However, if you are planning to accept an outside position, you should notify management.

Outside employment must not conflict in any way with your responsibilities within our company. You may not work for competitors nor may you take an ownership position with a competitor.

Employees may not conduct outside work or use company property, equipment or facilities in connection with outside work while on company time.
