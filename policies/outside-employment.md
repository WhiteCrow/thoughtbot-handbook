# Outside Employment

We hope that you will not find it necessary to seek additional outside employment, either part-time, contract, or otherwise. However, if you are planning to accept an outside position of any kind, you must check with your manager.

Outside employment should meet the restrictions in the non-solicit section of your employment contract, and must not conflict in any way with your responsibilities within our company. You may not work for competitors or clients, nor may you take an ownership position with a competitor.

Employees may not conduct outside work or use company property, equipment or facilities in connection with outside work while on company time.
