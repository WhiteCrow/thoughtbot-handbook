# Standards of Conduct

Each employee has an obligation to observe and follow the company's policies and to maintain proper standards of conduct at all times. If an individual's behavior interferes with the orderly and efficient operation of a department, corrective disciplinary measures will be taken.

## Disciplinary Action

Disciplinary action may include a verbal warning, written warning, suspension with or without pay, and/or discharge. The appropriate disciplinary action imposed will be determined by the company. The company does not guarantee that one form of action will necessarily precede another.

## The following may result in disciplinary action, up to and including discharge

* Violation of the company's policies or safety rules
* Insubordination
* Unauthorized or illegal possession, use or sale of controlled substances on work premises or during working hours, while engaged in company activities or in company vehicles
* Unauthorized possession, use or sale of weapons, firearms or explosives on work premises
* Theft or dishonesty
* Physical harassment
* Sexual harassment
* Disrespect toward fellow employees, visitors or other members of the public
* Performing outside work or use of company property, equipment or facilities in connection with outside work while on company time
* Poor attendance or poor performance.

These examples are not all inclusive. We emphasize that discharge decisions will be based on an assessment of all relevant factors.

Nothing in this policy is designed to modify our employment-at-will policy.
