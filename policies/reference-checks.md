# Reference Checks

Our company will not honor any oral requests for references. All requests must be in writing and on company letterhead. Generally, we will only confirm our employees' dates of employment and job title.

Under no circumstances should an employee provide another individual with information regarding current or former employees of our company. If you receive a request for reference information, please forward it to management.
