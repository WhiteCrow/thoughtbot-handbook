# Emergency Conditions

Severe weather, natural disasters, and local Emergencies are to be occasionally expected. Except in cases of such, we are all expected to work our regular hours.

During Emergency Conditions, employees are encouraged to work remotely with the approval of their supervisor. If you are unable to work remotely while the business remains open, the time should be marked as PTO. If you miss client time due to Emergency Conditions, please make arrangements to make-up that time as soon as possible.

If your area suffers a local Emergency Condition which does not impact the office, please contact your supervisor.

If Emergency Conditions require closing of the office, when possible, you will be notified by the Management by 6 am that day.

When the City or State where your office is located declares a State of Emergency, the office will be closed. The State of Emergency will take the place of Company notification.

In the event that we close the Office or you report to work without being notified in advance, you will be compensated in accordance with applicable state and federal wage and hour laws.

Exempt employees may be provided time off with pay when necessary to comply with state and federal wage and hour laws.
