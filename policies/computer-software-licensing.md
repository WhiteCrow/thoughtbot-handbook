# Computer Software Licensing

The company purchases or licenses the use of various computer software programs. Neither the company nor any of the company's employees have the right to duplicate this computer software or its related documentation. Unauthorized duplication of computer software is a federal offense, punishable by up to $250,000 fine and up to five years in jail.

The company does not condone the illegal duplication of software. You must use the software in accordance with the license agreement. This policy applies not only to individual desktop computers and laptops but to local area networks as well.

Employees learning of any misuse of software or related documentation within the company shall notify a member of management. Employees who reproduce, acquire or use unauthorized copies of computer software will be subject to discipline, up to and including discharge.
