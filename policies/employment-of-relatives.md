# Employment of Relatives

A supervisor may not hire or supervise an individual if that individual and the supervisor have an on-going romantic relationship, including but not limited to, marriage, or if that individual is a member of the supervisorâ€™s immediate family. The term "immediate family" refers to parents, children, sisters, brothers, nieces, nephews or other family members residing in the same household.

In the case of marriage of persons within the same department, an effort will be made to assign comparable job duties so as to minimize problems of supervision, safety, security and morale.
