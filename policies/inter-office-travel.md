# Inter-Office Travel

## Why

We want team members to travel to other locations to see how other projects are run, how team members in other locations interact, and identify ways to improve life in your own office.

If you happen to be traveling to a city where we have an office, we encourage you to spend an extra day working out of the office. If you are scheduling a trip just to see what you can learn, aim to schedule it between project rotations or for about 2-3 business days.

Do not work on your normal client project during this time. Pair with another designer or developer to learn something from their workflow. Document what you learn and share it in Campfire, Backpack, Trello, Basecamp, the blog, or another appropriate place. Attend your pair’s client meetings.

## How-To

Decide to travel to another thoughtbot office.

Send an email to [admin@thoughtbot.com](mailto:admin@thoughtbot.com) to schedule a good time to visit and approve the expense.  Describe why you’re going.

Unless we have had a recent bump in travelers (and therefore cost) or we don’t think there’s a lot to learn from the trip in the near future, it will be approved. It may also be approved, but for a different time (for example: a month or two later).

Your Office Manager will book the trip.

Travel.
