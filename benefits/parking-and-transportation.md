# Parking and Transportion

The Parking and Transportation benefits allows employees to pay for their parking and mass transit fees with pre-tax money taken out via payroll deductions.

When you enroll, you will receive a Choice Strategies VISA debit card that you may use for the benefits you selected: mass transit or parking fees or both!  For many of you, this is the same VISA debit card you already use for Medical or Dependent Care benefits. 

To enroll or make changes, please submit [the parking benefit enrollment form][enrollment-form].

You may resubmit this form to make changes to your enrollment. Changes must be submitted by the 10th of the month proceeding the month in which you would like the change to take effect.

If your recurring monthly cost is over the monthly limit, the amount under the limit will be deducted pre-tax, with the remainder deducted post-tax. The limits are currently $250/month for Parking and $130/month for Mass Transit.

These accounts have no "use it or lose it" clause â€“ thus, unused balances in your accounts will rollover from year to year. 

## Forgot Your Choice Strategies Card or it hasn't arrived yet?

You should personally pay for your transit pass or parking if you do not have your CS card and save your receipt. You can then submit the receipt to CS & get reimbursed out of your account.

## Choice Strategies Balance & Claims

You can check the balance of your choice strategies accounts (FSA, HRA, Parking & Transit) and file claims if you paid out of pocket on the Choice Strategies website.

## Boston

Employees in Boston who take the MBTA system have the option of receiving a Charlie Card instead of the Visa debit card. Each month, the Charlie Card will automatically be reloaded with a monthly pass. Use the same form linked above to enroll.

## San Francisco

You can put money pre-tax onto the Choice Strategies VISA Debit card and then link this card to autopay on your Clipper Card for monthly reloads. This covers BART, MUNI trains and buses, and other SF Bay transit systems that take Clipper. If your transportation method doesn't take Clipper, you can just pay with the VISA Debit card directly.
