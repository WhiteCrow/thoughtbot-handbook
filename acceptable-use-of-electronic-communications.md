# Acceptable use of Electronic Communications

This policy contains guidelines for Electronic Communications created, sent, received, used, transmitted, or stored using company communication systems or equipment and employee provided systems or equipment used either in the workplace, during working time or to accomplish work tasks. “Electronic Communications” include, among other things, messages, images, data or any other information used in e-mail, instant messages, voice mail, fax machines, computers, personal digital assistants (including Blackberry or similar text messaging devices), pagers, telephones, cellular and mobile phones including those with cameras, Intranet, Internet, back-up storage, information on a memory or flash key or card, jump or zip drive or any other type of internal or external removable storage drives. In the remainder of this policy, all of these communication devices are collectively referred to as “Systems.”

Employees may use our Systems to communicate internally with co-workers or externally with customers, suppliers, vendors, advisors, and other business acquaintances for business purposes.

All Electronic Communications contained in company Systems are company records and/or property. Although an employee may have an individual password to access our Systems, the Systems and Electronic Communications belong to the company. The Systems and Electronic Communications are accessible to the company at all times including periodic unannounced inspections. Our Systems and Electronic Communications are subject to use, access, monitoring, review, recording and disclosure without further notice. Our Systems and Electronic Communications are not confidential or private. The company's right to use, access, monitor, record and disclose Electronic Communications without further notice applies equally to employee-provided systems or equipment used in the workplace, during working time, or to accomplish work tasks.

Although incidental and occasional personal use of our Systems that does not interfere or conflict with productivity or the company's business or violate policy is permitted, personal communications in our Systems are treated the same as all other Electronic Communications and will be used, accessed, recorded, monitored, and disclosed by the company at any time without further notice. Since all Electronic Communications and Systems can be accessed without advance notice, employees should not use our Systems for communication or information that employees would not want revealed to third parties.

Employees may not use our Systems in a manner that violates our policies including but not limited to Non- Harassment, Sexual Harassment, Equal Employment Opportunity, Confidentiality of Client Matters, Care of Client Records, Protecting Company Information, Solicitation and Distribution, E-Mail Monitoring, Voicemail Monitoring, and Internet Usage. Employees may not use our Systems in any way that may be seen as insulting, disruptive, obscene, offensive, or harmful to morale. Examples of prohibited uses include, but are not limited to, sexually-explicit drawings, messages, images, cartoons, or jokes; propositions or love letters; ethnic or racial slurs, threats, or derogatory comments; or any other message or image that may be in violation of company policies.

In addition, employees may not use our Systems:

* To download, save, send or access any defamatory, discriminatory or obscene material;
* To download, save, send or access any site or content that the company might deem “adult entertainment;”
* To solicit employees or others;
* To attempt or to gain unauthorized or unlawful access to computers, equipment, networks, or systems of the company or any other person or entity;
* In connection with any infringement of intellectual property rights, including but not limited to copyrights; and
* In connection with the violation or attempted violation of any law.

An employee may not misrepresent, disguise, or conceal his or her identity or another’s identity in any way while using Electronic Communications; make changes to Electronic Communications without clearly indicating such changes; or use another person’s account, mail box, password, etc. without prior written approval of the account owner and without identifying the actual author.

Employees must always respect intellectual property rights such as copyrights and trademarks. Employees must not copy, use, or transfer proprietary materials of the company or others without appropriate authorization.

All Systems passwords and encryption keys must be available and known to the company. Employees may not install password or encryption programs without the written permission of our Systems Supervisor. Employees may not use the passwords and encryption keys belonging to others.

Numerous state and federal laws apply to Electronic Communications. The company will comply with applicable laws. Employees also must comply with applicable laws and should recognize that an employee could be personally liable and/or subject to fine and imprisonment for violation of applicable laws.
Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action up to and including discharge as well as possible civil liabilities or criminal prosecution. Where appropriate, the company may advise legal officials or appropriate third parties of policy violations and cooperate with official investigations. We will not, of course, retaliate against anyone who reports possible policy violations or assists with investigations.

For business purposes, management reserves the right to enter, search and/or monitor the company's private e- mail and voice mail systems and the files/transmission of any employee without advance notice and consistent with applicable state and federal laws. Employees should expect that communications that they send and receive by the company's private e-mail and voice mail systems will be disclosed to management. Employees should not assume that communications that they send and receive by the company's private e-mail and voice mail systems are private or confidential.

## Internet Usage

The Internet is intended for business use. Use of the Internet for illegal or illicit activities is strictly prohibited.

Our company's policies against sexual and other types of harassment apply fully to Internet usage, including the use of instant messaging programs. Violations of those policies are not permitted and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.
